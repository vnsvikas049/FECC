    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of a universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <P>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangements of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are<br> classified into groups and periods based on the their properties.</P>
    <h3>Chemical Equation</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <em>chemical equation.</em> Here's an example of a <em>chemical reaction.</em></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &#8594 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <i>(H<sub>2</sub>)</i>and oxygen gas<i>(O<sub>2</sub>)</i>to form water<i>(H<sub>2</sub>O)</i></p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p><b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reaction. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and chargeare conserved.<br>
    <sub>subscript</sub> indicates the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>Superscript</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in the ion.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemical plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the compositon of the air we breath to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
